With the rapid growth of electronic communication, spam email has become a pervasive issue, necessitating efficient and accurate detection systems to ensure legitimate messages are not mistakenly classified and that unwanted content is filtered effectively. This project investigates the application of various machine learning algorithms for spam email detection, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify emails as spam or ham. Using two distinct datasets, we apply TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to transform email text into features suitable for model training. We evaluate six classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Gradient Boosting, assessing their performance based on accuracy, precision, and recall. Our results indicate that Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting consistently achieve high accuracy across datasets, suggesting robust generalization capabilities. This study highlights the effectiveness of machine learning models for spam detection and proposes future directions, including advanced feature engineering and ensemble learning, to enhance performance and adaptability.
